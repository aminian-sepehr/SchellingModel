for a better understanding visit the link below.

in this repo, the model is implemented in C++ without any object orientation just for simplicity.

in order to find out how to run the model please chec out the Wiki. I will explain it there. There is an input example and a possible outcome (because of randomness, there is not a unique answer to the problem).
